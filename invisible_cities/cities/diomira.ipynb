    "\n",
    "The response of the NEXT detector to ionizing radiation (e.g, an interaction produced by a bb decay or a background event such as a photon or alpha particle interaction) is, in general, an ionization trail. For example, a 2.5 MeV electron produced by a bb decay or a photoelectric interaction induced by a high-energy gamma produced in the Bi-214 chain, propagates by some 10-20 cm in dense gas (at a pressure of ~10 bar). Ionization electrons ejected through the electron path will drift towards the anode and will be amplified in the EL grid. Each ionization electron produces up to 1,000 photons (depending on EL field), which are emitted isotropically, thus reaching the sensors in the anode (SiPMs) and in the cathode (PMTs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to DIMORA are the so-called Monte Carlo Raw Data (MCRD) files, produced by the NEXUS simulation. The MCRD files describe the \"true response\" of the NEXT sensors to the photon irradiation associated with an event. Photons are propagated through the chamber, and those reaching the sensors are eventually converted in a physical signal (photoelectrons or PES). The MCRD files contain vectors of PES for each sensor in the anode (tracking plane) and cathode (energy plane). The sampling rate in the PMTs of the energy plane is 1 ns (to allow a detailed simulation of the response of the front-end electronics, which runs at 40 MHz), while the sampling rate in the SiPMs is 1 mus, corresponding to the sampling rate of 1MHZ.\n",

The RWFs represent the response of the energy plane front-end electronics (FEE) to the input photoelectron current. The RWF include the effect of the FEE (convolution with LPF and HPF filters), the effect of the DAQ (sampling at 25 ns), and add the noise of FEE and DAQ.
